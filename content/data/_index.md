This year's data represents neronal activity within the human brain.
-> neuronal networks
Here I hope to present a text about how the data was created (with references to background).
I also need a section on how the data can be read/understood.
Finally we need locations to host the data, hopefully with mirrors.

Quote:
Currently, we’re looking at the activity of the neurons in real brains.

Interest:
changes in the network during stimulation.
For example, how do the neurons change their dynamics if we insert new ones, delete some (as in “patient had a stroke”), or stimulate a subset (as in “we are learning”)?

Data:

In rank_0_positions:
3D locations of neurons + label of brain region

In rank_0_in_network:
Connections of neurons via ID (Ingoing/outgoing)

In rank_0_calcium: 
Calcium value.
